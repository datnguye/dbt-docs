# dbt-docs

`dbdocs` is a Python CLI that generates an **alternative dbt documentation
site**: a dbt docs site + ERD + **column-level lineage**. Rather than dbt's
single-page bundle (or an mkdocs build), it reads dbt artifacts
(`manifest.json` / `catalog.json`) via the `dbterd` Python API, derives the
documentation data (catalog nodes, ERDs, node-level + column-level lineage), and
emits a **single self-contained `index.html`** with all that data base64-injected
as `window.dbdocsData`. A hand-written vanilla-JS SPA (no build step) renders it
client-side. No mkdocs, no mkdocs-material, no mike.

```

It's a flat single-package layout — `dbdocs/` lives at the repo root (no `src/`).
The package is grouped by pipeline stage: `core/` → `extract/` → `site/`.

## Workflows

Day-to-day work is driven by `task` (root `Taskfile.yml`). Slash commands wrap
the same targets so the agentic and manual paths stay aligned.

| Goal                                 | Task              | Slash command |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Sync the uv environment              | `task install`    | —             |
| Format + autofix                     | `task format`     | —             |
| Lint (format-check + ruff)           | `task lint`       | —             |
| Run tests at 100% coverage           | `task test`       | `/test`       |
| Build the self-contained site        | `task generate`   | `/generate`   |
| Serve the generated site locally     | `task serve`      | `/docs`       |
| Deploy a versioned build             | `task deploy`     | `/deploy`     |
| Cut a PyPI release                   | —                 | `/release`    |
| Build the jaffle_shop demo site      | `task demo`       | —             |
| Serve the project docs (mkdocs)      | `task docs:serve` | —             |
| Build the project docs (strict)      | `task docs:build` | —             |

`task --list` shows everything.

### Project docs vs the generated product

Two distinct "docs" live here — don't conflate them:

- **The product** is the self-contained SPA `dbdocs generate` emits (no mkdocs,
  no mike — see the design patterns below). It builds into `site/`.
- **The project's own documentation** at `dbdocs.datnguye.me` is a
  **mkdocs-material + mike** site under `docs/` (`mkdocs.yml`), published to the
  `gh-pages` branch by `.github/workflows/publish-docs.yml`. It builds into
  `site-docs/`. The "no mkdocs" rule is about the *product*, not this repo's docs.
- **A live demo** is built from the committed `tests/fixtures/jaffle_shop`
  artifacts via `docs/dbdocs-demo.yml` and published to `gh-pages` under `/demo`
  by `.github/workflows/build-demo.yml` (`keep_files: true`, so it coexists with
  the mike docs). It builds into `demo-site/`.

### CI/CD

GitHub Actions under `.github/workflows/`: `ci_pr.yml` (lint + 100%-coverage
tests across Python 3.10–3.13 on Linux/macOS/Windows), `pypi-publish.yml`
(trusted-publisher PyPI release on tag push), `publish-docs.yml` (mike deploy),
`build-demo.yml` (jaffle_shop demo), `stale.yml`.

### CLI lifecycle

`dbdocs` has three commands: `generate` (read artifacts → build the data dict →
emit the self-contained `site/index.html` + `site/dbdocs-data.json`) → `serve`
(stdlib `http.server` over the output dir; no live-reload — re-run generate) →
`deploy` (versioned build into `site/<version>/` + `versions.json`, no mike).
Site config lives in an optional `dbdocs.yml` (see `dbdocs.yml.example`):
`target_dir` (artifacts in), `output_dir` (site out), and an optional `dialect`
override for column-lineage parsing (defaults to the artifact's `adapter_type`).

## Conventions

- Python: `uv run ruff format && uv run ruff check` must pass. 100% test
  coverage (`task test`). Vendored third-party code (`extract/_sqlglot_lineage.py`)
  is omitted from coverage, not gamed with no-cover pragmas.
- No relative imports. All imports at module top (`ruff PLC0415` enforces this).
- One class per file (exception: multiple exception classes may share one file).
  No nested functions/classes.
- Specific exception types in `try/except` — never bare `except:` /
  `except Exception`.
- No backward-compat shims unless explicitly asked.
- DRY in tests — share fixtures via `tests/conftest.py`.
- The SPA (vanilla JS under `site/bundle/`) owns presentation; the Python only
  assembles the data dict. Vendored JS libs are committed (offline, no CDN) and
  shipped in the wheel via the `dbdocs/site/bundle/**/*` artifacts glob.
- The interactive graphs (DAG + ERD) are a React Flow app under `frontend/`
  (React+TS, Vite). Graph-UI changes need Node: `task frontend:install &&
  task frontend:build` rebuilds the **committed** bundle at
  `dbdocs/site/bundle/assets/graph/`. `dbdocs generate` stays pure-Python and
  build-step-free — it just copies that prebuilt bundle.

## Design patterns

The load-bearing patterns of this codebase are catalogued — with file:line
evidence — in the imported config below. Extend the established pattern instead
of inventing a parallel one.

@.claude/design_patterns.md

- When you add or remove a load-bearing pattern, update
  `.claude/design_patterns.md` in the same change (new entry + TOC), with a
  concrete file:line citation.
- Line numbers there can drift; the cited symbol is authoritative — grep it.

## Agentic setup

- `docs-dev` agent (`memory: project`) — owns `dbdocs/` and `tests/`.
- `release-manager` agent (`memory: local`) — cuts PyPI releases.
- Skills: `dbterd-api` (consuming dbt artifacts/ERDs), `spa-site` (the data-dict
  + generated-SPA contract), `release` (the release procedure).
- Hooks: `block-secrets.sh` (PreToolUse, denies secret-file access),
  `post-edit-check.sh` (PostToolUse, ruff-checks edited `.py` files).

## Agent memory

`docs-dev` uses `memory: project` — its scratchpad is committed and shared with
teammates. `release-manager` uses `memory: local` — personal, gitignored.
Because project memory lands in git:

- Never write secrets, tokens, or customer data into agent memory.
- Never write things only true for your local setup (paths to personal dbt
  projects, ports you picked).
- Do write things that remain true across sessions: dbterd/sqlglot quirks,
  architectural decisions, recurring pitfalls.

Agents curate their own `MEMORY.md` index — do not hand-edit it.

## External docs via context7 MCP

`context7` is configured in `.mcp.json`. Use it to pull up-to-date docs for
`dbterd`, `sqlglot`, and `click` before writing non-trivial integration code.
Prefer context7 over guessing from training data when library behavior matters.

## Delegating work

- Code changes in `dbdocs/`: delegate to `docs-dev`.
- Anything touching the data-dict shape or the SPA: read the `spa-site` skill
  first.
- dbterd integration: read the `dbterd-api` skill first.
- Release cuts: `release-manager` agent / `/release`.
